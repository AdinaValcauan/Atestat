# Atestat
This is the first project I did with HTML and CSS. I did it when I was in the 12th grade as my "atestat"

  One of the biggest struggle was with the main page, which is supposed to be a cover of the 'journal'. Trying to arrange the cloud and making the page
responsive were some of the problems I had. 


  Making a responsive design was a challenge for me. I was able to do that on the majority of the pages, but not on all of them (ex the cover page).
